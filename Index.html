        <h2>Here's a time line of Sultan El-Mansour <span class="golden"></span>: </h2>
           <ul>
            <li><strong>1549  </strong>- Sultan El-Mansour <span class="golden"></span> born in Fes, Morocco</li>
            <li><strong>1578  </strong>- Sultan El-Mansour <span class="golden"></span> succeeded his brother and become the sultan of morocco.</li>   
            <li><strong>1590 </strong>- Sultan El-Mansour <span class="golden"></span> launched an invasion of the <abbr title="West Africa">Songhai Empire</abbr> with an army of only 4,000 men </li>
            <li><strong> 1600  </strong>- Sultan  El-Mansour <span class="golden"></span> sent his Secretary Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud as ambassador of Morocco to the Court of Queen Elizabeth I of England to negotiate an alliance against Spain.</li>
            <li><strong>1603  </strong>- Sultan El-Mansour <span class="golden"></span> died of the plague in 1603 and was succeeded by Zidan Abu Maali.</li>
           </ul>
        <p>"Through astute diplomacy al-Mansur resisted the demands of the Ottoman sultan, to preserve Moroccan independence. By playing the Europeans and Ottomans against one another al-Mansur excelled in the art of balance of power diplomacy. Eventually he spent far more than he collected. He attempted to expand his holdings through conquest, and although initially successful in their military campaign against the Songhay Empire, the Moroccans found it increasingly difficult to maintain control over the conquered locals as time went on. Meanwhile, as the Moroccans continued to struggle in the Songhay, their power and prestige on the world stage declined significantly<br>
        Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur was one of the first authorities to take action on smoking in 1602, towards the end of his reign. The ruler of the Saadi dynasty used the religious tool of fatwas (Islamic legal pronouncements) to discourage the use of tobacco"</p>
